## About

"Simon Draws!" is a game of memory üß† combined with drawing ‚úçÔ∏è.

By using on-device machine learning Simon can learn in real-time how you draw symbols and create a personalized experience for each user.

You can checkout the [youtube video](https://youtu.be/KyiXl2NFWHg) üì∫ or download the .playgroundbook file and import it to Swift Playgrounds on iPad.

## How to play

First of all, you will have to tell Simon which theme of symbols you prefer and then draw each icon a couple of times, so that Simon can familiarize with your drawing style.

Afterward you will be shown a sequence of icons and your task is to draw them in the same order as they are presented to you.

Play. Repeat. Play üòù
